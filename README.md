Hello Sir,

My name is Gungun Soni. I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from the University of Allahabad with a CGPA of 8.4, where I built a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, operating systems, and full-stack development. Alongside my academics, I applied these concepts through hands-on projects. One of my key achievements was building an AI-powered mock interview platform using Next.js and Firebase, where I integrated voice interaction and real-time feedback to simulate human-like interviews. Another project I’m proud of is a chatbot powered by Hugging Face LLMs that answers questions from uploaded PDFs using FAISS and LangChain for semantic search—demonstrating my ability to architect and deploy complex AI systems.

Technically, I’m proficient in C++ and have a working knowledge of Linux commands, along with version control tools like Git and GitHub. Over the past three years, I’ve also solved 500+ problems on LeetCode in C++, which has significantly strengthened my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills. All these skills make me the right fit for this role.

At Synopsys, I look forward to bringing energy, adaptability, and initiative. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling challenging problems. I’m especially excited about the opportunity to contribute to the development of high-performance simulation models and tools that power innovations in industries. I'm also deeply aligned with Synopsys’ mission.

I am attaching my resume link for your reference:-
